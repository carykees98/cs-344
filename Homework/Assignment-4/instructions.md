1. Show the resulting array from running Union Find with Weighted Union on the following pairs:

(0,1) (7,6) (8,9) (3,2) (1,3) (12,5) (1,5) (4,7) (4,9) (10,11) (11,4) (5,11)

2. Show the resulting array from running Union Find with Path Compression on the above pairs.

In my code, when two components of the same size are unioned, the representative of the second component will point at the the representative of the first component.  You must use that version.
