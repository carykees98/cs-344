# Homework 2 - Instructions

In this assignment, you need to calculate the asymptotic running time of 10 functions in this file (given.cpp):
```
1. insert
2. insertionSort
3. remove
4. indexOf_iter
5. selectionSort
6. binSearches
7. rmzeroes
8. keepDoubling
9. partition
10. merge
```
Most of the functions are useful. A few are not very useful. If you want to see what they do, you can use my print_array function to take a look. But it is not necessary to understand what they do in order to complete this assignment.

For each function, calculate its running time mathematically. Then test your calculation experimentally by running the doubling test. The main program in this file performs the doubling test. 

All you need to submit is a list of each function name with its running time.
