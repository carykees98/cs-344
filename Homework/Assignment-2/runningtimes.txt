I used O in place of theta since I can't type theta as a symbol.

1. insert

	- Calculated time: O(n)
	- Experimental time: O(n)
 
2. insertionSort

	- Calculated time: O(n^2)
	- Experimental time: O(n^2)
 
3. remove

	- Calculated time: O(n)
	- Experimental time: O(n)
 
4. indexOf_iter

	- Calculated time: O(lg(n))
	- Experimental time: O(1) 
 
5. selectionSort

	- Calculated time: O(n^2)
	- Experimental time: O(n^2)
 
6. binSearches

	- Calculated time: O(n)
	- Experimental time: O(n)
 
7. rmzeroes

	- Calculated time: O(nlg(n))
	- Experimental time: O(n^2)
 
8. keepDoubling

	- Calculated time: O(n^3)
	- Experimental time: O(n^3)
 
9. partition

	- Calculated time: O(n^2)
	- Experimental time: O(1)
 
10. merge

	- Calculated time: O(n)
	- Experimental time: O(n)
